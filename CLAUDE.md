# CLAUDE.md

Working notes for AI/code sessions on this repo. `README.md` is the full
reference; this is just the things that will bite you if you don't know them.

## The stack, briefly

Next.js 16 (App Router) · React 19 · Tailwind v4 · TypeScript · Supabase
(Sydney) · Resend (transactional email) · Mailchimp (newsletter campaigns) ·
Vercel (auto-deploys on push to `main`, functions pinned to `syd1`).

## Gotchas (read before changing anything here)

- **Deploy = `git push origin main`.** GitHub triggers a production Vercel
  build on push to `main`; other branches make preview URLs. There is no
  local Vercel link. The production Vercel/Supabase/Resend/Mailchimp
  accounts may differ from whatever a generic MCP connection shows, so do
  not assume a project you can see via tooling is this site's.
- **Migrations are applied by hand** in the Supabase dashboard SQL editor;
  there is no runner. As of 2026-07-06 every migration in
  `supabase/migrations/` is applied to production. Write new ones safe to
  re-run (`if not exists`, `drop policy if exists`), with SHORT lines and
  short single-piece string literals: the owner's clipboard path corrupts
  long lines and multi-line `||` string concatenations, producing misleading
  errors like `relation "a" does not exist`. No JSON literals in seeds; seed
  skeleton rows and author content in the admin instead.
- **Anon key is insert-only on form tables** (RLS). Public form routes can
  `insert` but cannot `select`. Duplicate protection is client-side
  (`components/SubmitLockForm.tsx`). All eight form routes also run the
  server-side bot filter `checkSubmission` from `lib/anti-spam.ts`.
- **Service key boundary.** `lib/supabase-admin.ts` (`getAdminSupabase`,
  env `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`) bypasses RLS. Only server-only code imports it:
  the cron route, the unsubscribe routes/page, the Mailchimp webhook, and
  the newsletter/flow send libs. Never import it anywhere client-reachable.
- **Newsletter campaigns send through Mailchimp, not Resend.** When
  `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY` + `MAILCHIMP_AUDIENCE_ID` are set (they are, in prod),
  `lib/newsletter-send.ts` creates and sends a Mailchimp campaign to the
  audience "TEDxNewy Email Subscribers". Without them it falls back to
  per-recipient Resend, which hits the free 100/day cap on real lists.
  Transactional email (confirmations, Quick Compose, welcome flow) stays on
  Resend either way. The Mailchimp API key expires around July 2027; when
  sends go quiet, rotate it first.
- **Scheduling runs on a Vercel cron** hitting `/api/cron/newsletter` every
  5 minutes with `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`. It sends due
  newsletters (atomic claim, stale-"sending" recovery after 15 min) and the
  welcome-flow drip steps (claim-first ledger upserts on
  `subscriber_flow_sends`, so overlapping runs cannot double-send).
- **One block editor drives all rich email.** Blocks (header, text, image,
  two-column, button, video, countdown, divider) are defined in
  `lib/newsletter-blocks.ts`, edited with `app/admin/_blocks/BlockCanvas.tsx`,
  and rendered server-side by `lib/newsletter-render.tsx` (React Email). The
  newsletter, the subscriber-flow steps, and Quick Compose all use it. The
  renderer's `unsubscribeUrl` is optional: newsletters and flow steps pass it
  (compliance footer), Quick Compose omits it (ad-hoc recipients have no
  tokens). Keep multi-part JSX text as single string expressions in the
  footer: React Email separates adjacent text nodes with HTML comments and
  some mail clients eat the whitespace at that boundary.
- **Bulk email is batched on purpose.** `sendBulkEmail()` and
  `sendBulkEmailPersonalized()` send via Resend's batch endpoint in chunks
  of 100 with a paced per-recipient fallback. Do not replace with a naive
  per-recipient loop: Resend rate-limits at 2 req/sec and the old loop
  silently dropped everyone after the first ~2.
- **Events and the public header nav are CMS content** (`cms_events`,
  `cms_nav_groups`, `cms_nav_items`) edited at `/admin/events` and
  `/admin/navigation`. Public consumers (`components/Nav.tsx` via
  `getNavConfig()`, `/events`, `/salons`, the home page) all fall back to
  static content (`lib/nav-fallback.ts`, `lib/data.ts`) if Supabase is
  unreachable, so the site never breaks. Announced events with
  `show_in_nav` flow into the Upcoming menu automatically. Nav caching is
  `unstable_cache` tag "nav" (revalidate 300); admin actions revalidate it.
- **The seven form admin pages live in one hub** at `/admin/forms` (registry
  in `app/admin/forms/registry.ts`, slugs: youth-futures, student-speaker,
  talk-night, nominations, volunteers, sponsors, contact). The old routes
  redirect. Admin sidebar config is the single source
  `app/admin/nav-config.ts` (consumed by AdminShell and the dashboard).
- **`RESEND_FROM` must be a verified `tedxnewy.com.au` sender** (prod uses
  `noreply@tedxnewy.com.au`). The `onboarding@resend.dev` fallback gets
  spam-filed.
- **Email errors are swallowed on form routes** (a send failure must not
  break a submit). The newsletter/flow pipelines do NOT swallow; they record
  results. Source of truth for delivery is Resend's log at
  `/admin/emails/history` and Mailchimp's campaign reports.
- **Admin performance patterns:** auth is deduplicated per request via React
  `cache()` in `lib/cms-auth.ts`; every admin section has a `loading.tsx`
  skeleton; form-action buttons use `app/admin/PendingButtons.tsx`
  (useFormStatus). Keep new admin pages on these patterns. No
  `window.confirm`/`window.prompt`: use `app/admin/ConfirmDialog.tsx`.
- **Verify before pushing:** `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build`. The
  build prints `ENOTFOUND your-project-ref.supabase.co` when the local
  `.env` has a placeholder URL. Expected noise, not a failure (exit 0).

## Header nav behaviour (deliberate design)

On dark-hero routes (`/`, `/60-second-talk-night`) the bar is transparent
with white links over the hero; opening a menu there tints it deep red to
match the page. Scrolled past the hero, or on any other page, the bar and
its open-menu state use the warm cream style with dark links.

## Writing style

User preference: **no em or en dashes** in copy or docs. Use commas, colons,
or full stops. Applies to email copy, UI text, content, and these files.
